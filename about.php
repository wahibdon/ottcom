			<h2>Our Story</h2>
			<p>OTT’s unique point of difference is our ability to simultaneously create long-term brand positions while driving next day sales. It requires energy, creativity, tenacity and the ability to embrace and manage complexity.</p>
			<p>Sometimes it involves a national focus, other times a neighborhood-by-neighborhood approach is best. It is our job to deliver creative ways to make your marketing dollars work harder</p>
            <p>Brands and Retailers operate in a marketplace filled with rapidly evolving technologies, demographic shifts, and economic uncertainty that greatly alter a consumer’s speed of life and render traditional approaches to marketing obsolete.</p>
			<p>We help our clients develop deeper foresight and insight to consumer behavior beyond conventional data points, providing the means to look ahead, plan ahead and move ahead.</p>
			<p>For over 45 years, we have helped build brands by finding innovative and compelling ways to connect with audiences. Our success is based solely on the success of our clients’ business. After all, advertising that wins awards but fails to drive business is simply art.</p>
            <h2>Culture</h2>
			<p>OTT Communications delivers advertising – in all its forms – that works.</p>
			<p>For 47 years, we have helped build brands by finding innovative and compelling ways to connect with audiences. Our success is based solely on the success of our clients’ business. After all, advertising that wins awards but fails to drive business is simply art.</p>
			<p>That premise pervades everything we do. Every image we create. Every line we write. Every photograph we shoot. Every marketing plan we develop. If it doesn’t work for you, it doesn’t work for us.</p>
			<p>When you enter a relationship with OTT, you enter a partnership. And as a partner, we work closely with you to accomplish the goals we’ve set. Together. As a team.</p>
			<p>If successful advertising means anything to you, rest assured it means everything to us.</p>
